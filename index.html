                    <p> Hi I'm Jared, I grew up in Los Angeles, CA. I received my bachelors from CU Boulder in 2011 and started working with my dad at his business he founded almost 42 years ago called Avon Rent A Car/Truck/Van. About 4 years later, I decided to go back to school so I applied to some MBA programs. I graduated in 2016 from Pepperdine University in Malibu with my MBA and went back to work at Avon where I'm currently at today. In my spare time, I like to write and record songs with my guitar and keyboard. Also Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto, and Rocket League are some of my favorite video games I like to play. I also like to travel and some of my favorite places so far are Italy, Greece, Spain, South of France, and Israel. Hawaii and Cabo are pretty cool too.
