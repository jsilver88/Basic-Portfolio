        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA. Music is a big passion of mine, I can play both guitar and piano and can pretty much learn any song by ear. I graduated CU Boulder in 2011 and moved back to Cali to work for my dad at his company, Avon Rent A Car. About 3 years into it, I decided I needed more business knowledge so I applied to business schools. I graduated in 2016 from Pepperdine University in Malibu, CA with my MBA and went back to the family business where I'm currently at today. I've always been pretty tech savvy and have found computers and technology interesting so,
           I started learning how to code.
