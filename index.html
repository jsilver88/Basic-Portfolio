        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA. Started learning piano at 5 and guitar around 10, I've been playing ever since and continue to write music on the side. I graduated CU Boulder in 2011 and moved back to Cali to work for my dad at his company, Avon Rent A Car. About 3 years into it, I decided I needed more business knowledge so I applied to business schools. I graduated in 2016 from Pepperdine University in Malibu, CA with my MBA and went back to the family business where I'm currently at today. I've always been pretty tech savvy and have found computers and technology interesting so,
           I started learning how to code.
