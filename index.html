                    <p> Hi I'm Jared, I grew up in Los Angeles, CA. I received my bachelors from CU Boulder in 2011 and came back to Cali to work with my dad at the business he founded almost 42 years ago, Avon Rent A Car/Truck/Van. About 4 years later, I decided I needed a better understanding of business in general so I applied to business schools. I graduated in 2016 from Pepperdine University in Malibu with my MBA and went back to work at Avon where I'm currently at today. In my spare time, I like to play music and write songs. I've always been pretty interested in web development so,
                        I started learning how to write code and I'm currently enrolled thru UCLA extension's coding boot camp.
